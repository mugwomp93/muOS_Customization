# Perfect Overlays for RG35XX Plus/H/SP/2024 and others
(step-by-step instructions for muOS are in the readmes)

These are adaptations of [1playerinsertcoin's Perfect GB, GBC, and GBA Miyoo Mini overlays](https://www.reddit.com/u/1playerinsertcoin/s/yhapRMwOJz).

The versions hosted here have had minor alignment fixes for the RG35XX Plus/H/SP/2024 series of devices and have been tested using muOS. They will likely work on other 640x480 systems and CFW, but ymmv with regard to instructions and alignment.

For the original RG35XX, see my Garlic OS repository.

For the Miyoo Mini (Plus), see 1playerinsertcoin's original Reddit posts.

The main zip will be updated once troubleshooting of the GBC overlay has been completed.

I recommend downloading the updated zips for DMG/GBP and GBA in the meantime if you don't want to wait. I'll post a separate GBC zip once it's ready so you won't have to download the whole bundle again.

I've left the outdated bundle up for now as the issues with the GBC overlay are minor compared with the DMG/GBP overlays, but there will also be new GBC border and no grid/no shadow options in the new version.

1. **Perfect DMG/GBP Overlays** - updated 2024-09-14<br>Updated versions have a corrected 533 px grid (old was 532 px), a better shader recommendation, and a significantly improved border shadow. Much crisper image than the previous version. There are also no grid, no shadow, and no grid + no shadow options for all borders.<br><br>Comparison of new vs. old:<br>![DMG_old_new_comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24efce93-6c46-49d5-b2af-20278a3f5261)<br><br>Border options:<br>![DMG_GBP_example_borders](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddad0d35-1a17-4564-aed2-97aa497bd7db)<br><br>
2. **Perfect GBA Overlays** - updated 2024-09-14<br>Grids are the same as before; however, the border shadow is slightly improved and I've included a few more options that I've made for folks since posting the previous versions.
