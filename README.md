# [Perfect Overlays for RG35XX Plus/H/SP/2024](https://github.com/mugwomp93/muOS_Customization/blob/main/Perfect_Overlays_for_muOS.zip) (and possibly other devices)

*Settings with step-by-step instructions for muOS are included in the readmes in the various zip files.*<br><br>

These are adaptations of 1playerinsertcoin's Perfect [GB](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/18e2o0z/i_remastered_my_game_boy_dmg_overlay/), [GBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/1857xa7/i_made_a_game_boy_color_overlay/), and [GBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/18ovuld/i_made_a_game_boy_advance_overlay/) Miyoo Mini overlays.

The versions hosted here have had minor alignment fixes for the RG35XX Plus/H/SP/2024 series of devices and have been tested on a RG35XX Plus using muOS. These overlays may work on other 640x480 devices and CFWs, though ymmv with regard to setup and alignment (since all three of the devices that I'm familiar with have minor scaling and positioning differences). Russ at Retro Game Corps has put together an excellent [guide to overlays and shaders on retro handheld devices](https://retrogamecorps.com/2024/09/01/guide-shaders-and-overlays-on-retro-handhelds/) that you may find useful if you're looking to get these working on another platform, or really just in general.

For the original RG35XX, see my [Garlic OS repository](https://github.com/mugwomp93/GarlicOS_Customization).

For the Miyoo Mini (Plus), see [1playerinsertcoin's original Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/u/1playerinsertcoin/s/yhapRMwOJz). It's worth checking out all of their other overlays, too.

***Updated 2024-09-26:***
- Added versions using the optimized (non-bright) Perfect GBA overlay to the Perfect_Overlays_for_muOS and Perfect_GBA_for_muOS zips
- Added a zip with just the new versions (Perfect_GBA_non-bright_only) for people who had previously downloaded the GBA overlays<br><br>

The [Perfect_Overlays_for_muOS zip file](https://github.com/mugwomp93/muOS_Customization/blob/main/Perfect_Overlays_for_muOS.zip) is a compilation of all three system-specific zip files (DMG/GBP, GBC, and GBA).
