*Step-by-step instructions for muOS are included in the readmes in the various zip files.*<br><br>

These are adaptations of 1playerinsertcoin's Perfect [GB](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/18e2o0z/i_remastered_my_game_boy_dmg_overlay/), [GBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/1857xa7/i_made_a_game_boy_color_overlay/), and [GBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/comments/18ovuld/i_made_a_game_boy_advance_overlay/) Miyoo Mini overlays.

The versions hosted here have had minor alignment fixes for the RG35XX Plus/H/SP/2024 series of devices and have been tested using muOS. They will likely work on other 640x480 systems and CFW, but ymmv with regard to instructions and alignment. Russ at Retro Game Corps has put together an excellent [guide to overlays and shaders on retro handheld devices](https://retrogamecorps.com/2024/09/01/guide-shaders-and-overlays-on-retro-handhelds/) that you may find useful.

For the original RG35XX, see my [Garlic OS repository](https://github.com/mugwomp93/GarlicOS_Customization).

For the Miyoo Mini (Plus), see [1playerinsertcoin's original Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/u/1playerinsertcoin/s/yhapRMwOJz). It's worth checking out all of their other overlays, too.
